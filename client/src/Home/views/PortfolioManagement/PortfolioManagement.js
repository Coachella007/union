            You determine that profile with us on the basis of a very thorough analysis. Within your profile,
             we spread the risk by investing worldwide in bonds, alternative investments and in various sectors,

            <p>
            Especially in these times, it is important that you are aware that investing is something for the
             longer term and that investing involves risks. Read more below about the possibilities offered by Portfolio 
             Management and the considerations you need to make. Good to know: a conversation with an Investment Adviser is always free of obligation and can be done via 'Beeldbankieren', our own video-banking service

          <h3>Invest for the longer term</h3>
          <p>
          It is important that you are aware that investing is for the longer term. If we follow the past,
           there will always be periods of decline as there are now and periods of recovery. A broad spread 
           and a longer term can contribute to the chance of a positive return over a long period of time.

          <h3>Investing entails risks</h3>
          <p>
          Investing entails risks. You could lose (some of) the money you invested. If you are going to invest, 
          it is important that you are aware of this. Invest with money you can spare. Keep a buffer for unforeseen 
          circumstances. Also think of an extra buffer for difficult economic times
