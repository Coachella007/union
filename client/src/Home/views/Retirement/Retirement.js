      <h2>The act of retiring is easy, but staying retired is hard!</h2>
      <hr/>
      <p>Why, you may ask? Well because retirement has different rules than 
      when you were working for a paycheck. Everyone dreams about what life will be like not having
       to clock in from 8-5 but most don’t properly plan for the changes that happen. What changes
        are we referring to?</p>
        <h5>Change in your attitude, tolerance and capacity for investment risk in retirement:</h5>

        Many of our clients talk about continued employment in retirement and we think that’s an amazing option
         if it fits what you want to do and how you want to spend your time. But when that time comes, many of our 
         clients choose not to and according to Employee Benefit Research Institute, our clients are not alone. In
          their 2017 study they said that 79% of pre-retirees expect to have some sort of continued employment in
           retirement, but only 29% do so. Retiring is such a drastic change that the best laid plans sometimes don’t 
           come to fruition. At Cryptify we focus on creating dynamic retirement income strategies to meet your needs
            in this ever-changing world</p>
          <p><i className="flaticon-checked" style={{marginRight:"10px",fontSize:"20px",color:"#262566"}} />
          With corporate pension plans vanishing you need ways to create pension like income streams in retirement.
           The foundation of steady guaranteed income in retirement can be the difference between running out of money
            in retirement and living the lifestyle you’ve saved so hard for. Take a look at the graphic below. To sum 
            up the information – Retirees with not pension like income strategies are more likely to run a deficit in
             retirement.</p>
             <p><i className="flaticon-checked" style={{marginRight:"10px",fontSize:"20px",color:"#262566"}} />
             At Cryptify, we take the process of planning for these changes and implementing the appropriate strategies
              very seriously.</p>

      <h5>CHOOSE PROGRAM WITHDRAWAL AT RETIREMENT</h5>
      <p>Programmed Withdrawal is a product offered by the Pension Fund Administrators for periodic payments 
      (monthly/quarterly) to a retiree. It is a structured periodic payment based on the peculiarities of the 
      retiree, the Retirement Savings Account balance is spread over the expected life span of the retiree while
       the funds remain in the custody and are managed by the Pension Fund Administrator. The benefits of programmed 
       withdrawal over annuity include:</p>

          <p><i className="flaticon-checked" style={{marginRight:"10px",fontSize:"20px",color:"#262566"}} />
          Programmed Withdrawal serves as social security for retirees while annuity does not qualify as social security.</p>
          <p><i className="flaticon-checked" style={{marginRight:"10px",fontSize:"20px",color:"#262566"}} />
          Retirement benefits is in individual RSA account while Retirement benefits under annuity is in a pool of fund.</p>
          <p><i className="flaticon-checked" style={{marginRight:"10px",fontSize:"20px",color:"#262566"}} />
          Retiree monthly pension is reviewed for enhancement from time to time under programmed withdrawal by the National
           Pension Commission, under annuity there is usually no incremental review of payment assured for life.</p>
           <p><i className="flaticon-checked" style={{marginRight:"10px",fontSize:"20px",color:"#262566"}} />
           The investment income earned per contributor is credited into the RSA balance of the retiree while the profit
            on annuity fund belongs to the insurance company.</p>
            <p><i className="flaticon-checked" style={{marginRight:"10px",fontSize:"20px",color:"#262566"}} />
            Annuity is guaranteed for only 10 years. If the Retiree dies after the guarantee period, beneficiaries are
             not entitled to the deceased balance in the Annuity pool. However, Programmed Withdrawal benefits the retirees
              as well as the next of kin, because the outstanding account The historical volatility and downside risk of
               each investment balance will be paid to the beneficiary upon retiree’s death</p>

          Most people collect their lump sum at retirement to have fun. Perhaps to travel or buy a boat. 
          After all, as you get older, you may be inclined to stay at home and won’t get a chance to spend 
          the money on something fun. But the question is “what if you live to age 90?” You need to keep some 
          resources in reserve so you don’t become a burden to your family.
