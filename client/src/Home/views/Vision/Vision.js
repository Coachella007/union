      <h2>Our Corporate Mission</h2>
      <p>
      Our mission is to invest in companies and funds which bring meaningful changes to the world and economic benefits to our investors. Our main business lines include making direct investments in private companies and managing funds of funds with themes in impact investing. We also engage in long-term partnerships to nurture strategic investment opportunities and to co-invest with other institutional investors and general partners.
      </p>
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Union Finance Investments was founded in 2016 by a group of entrepreneurs and finance professionals, who are passionate about impact investment. The founding group, its associates and the advisors support us with management experience and business relationships with various partners in the world</p>
      <p>We are licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission in 2018 to conduct regulated activities for advising on securities and asset management in Hong Kong, followed by the establishment of our Canadian representative office in Toronto to better serve our investors and promote impact investment.</p>
      <p>Within the first three year of our operation, we have become a provisional signatory of the United Nations-supported Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI), a member of Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), and a certified B Corporation (B Corp). To further strengthen our identity in impact investment, we proactively approach professional organizations and academic institutions for joint research projects, speak regularly in industry conferences and publish articles on impact investment, ESG and sustainability topics</p>
      <p>We also forge various partnerships with governmental and consulate-level offices, incubators, accelerators, co-working space operators and venture investment networks to source top quality deals and expand market coverage.</p>
      <p>Our success relies on our profound global corporate and governmental relationships, ample access to market resources, proven ability in negotiating deals, managing risks and formulating proper exit strategies.</p>
      <p>The majority of our assets under management are sourced from the founding group and its associates. We welcome impact investment mandates from asset owners and other asset managers, such as ultra-high-net-worth clients, family offices, foundations, endowments, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other corporate or institutional portfolios</p>
